U-Boot for the Gateworks Ventana Product Family boards

This file contains information for the port of U-Boot to the Gateworks
Ventana Product family boards.

1. Boot source, boot from NAND
------------------------------

The i.MX6 BOOT ROM expects some headers that provide details of NAND layout
and bad block information (referred to as 'bootstreams') which are replicated
multiple times in NAND. The number of replications is configurable through
board strapping options and eFUSE settings.  The Freescale 'kobs-ng'
application from the Freescale LTIB BSP, which runs under Linux, must be used
to program the bootstream in order to setup the replicated headers correctly.

The Gateworks Ventana boards with NAND flash have been factory programmed
such that their eFUSE settings expect 2 copies of the boostream (this is
specified by providing kobs-ng with the --search_exponent=1 argument). Once in
Linux with MTD support for the NAND on /dev/mtd0 you can program the boostream
with:

kobs-ng init -v -x --search_exponent=1 u-boot.imx

To build U-Boot for the SabreLite board:

 make gw_ventana_config
 make u-boot.imx
